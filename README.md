This project focuses on scraping reviews from Goodreads. The code is ready to run directly in Google Colab without any additional configuration.
Feel free to modify it to save the results into a CSV file.
Thank you!


Assign the 'link' variable with the URL of a Goodreads webpage that directs to the review section of a specific book. Ensure the URL points to the correct page where all reviews for the book are displayed, allowing the script to function properly.
