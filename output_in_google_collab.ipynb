As a linguist, I loved reading the way the chimps learn language. Before the project fell apart, chimps were already teaching there young without any outside assistance. I wish that there project would not have fallen apart for two reasons - first, the language development in the animals as future generations learned sign language would have gotten even cooler and second, because reading about tortured chimps is depressing.\n",

Fouts gives you a front and center peek into our closest animal cousins' perspectives and experiences of the world. It dazzles. You begin the memoir thinking that he is the luckiest guy in the world, having, through several twists of fate (described with appealing self-effacement), landed in a particular academic program, which, in turn, leads to life-long work with chimpanzees.\n",

They show a sense of humor, personal characteristics, and even compassion (such as when Washoe rescues another chimp from drowning).

His tours of medical research facilities and the tiny, isolated cages in which chimps are essentially poisoned and tortured, will break your heart. Aptly he uses Shakespeare's quote to warn us against having \"All pity choked by custom of fell deed\" (p. 318).\n",

You'll learn about everything from childhood autism, to the evolution of language, to the fight for the humane treatment of lab animals. This book is flawlessly constructed and flows effortlessly from start to finish, making it a book that I couldn't put down for two days straight. What started out an experiment to teach one chimp how to communicate using sign language, exploded into a phenomonon. The auther dedicated his whole life to humanely working with and protecting these chimps (often times, at the expense of his own personal gain). As a side note, the author and Central Washington State cooperated some years ago to create a permanent home for a handful of the signing chimps. Called the Chimpanzee & Human Communication Institute, it can be toured for a small donation.\n",

Naast zijn studies, en later zijn werk als professor, bekommert Foust zich heel erg om het lot van chimpansees die in biomedische laboratoria gehouden worden.

I was reminded of this when my family visited the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., last month and observed the gorillas. I recognize the realities of habitat loss and other aspects of modern life that make it impossible to return many of these beings to the wild, but they're just a little too close for comfort. I empathize with them a little too much to make watching them in captivity completely comfortable.\n",

My daughter and I are now looking at the adopt-a-chimp and membership options at the foundation, and wondering if we can swing a visit.\n",

            "  Content: This book was a heartwarming and heartbreaking story about people--not all of them human people. It tells the story of Roger, a chimpanzee language researcher, and his companion and colleague in his study, a chimpanzee named Washoe. Washoe is crossfostered with humans in her early life, where she learns to use American Sign Language. Along the way we meet other chimpanzees, each with their own personality and style. Sadly Roger helplessly watches many of them head into biomedical research laboratories, where they are considered property without any rights.\n",
            "I would recommend this book to anyone, although I caution that some of the things the chimps endure (Never with Roger, who is a respectful man now dedicated to animal rights) are so horrible I felt nauseated. This book was published in 1997, about two years after I declared my vegetarianism at eight. I feel heartbroken that this was happening while I doted on my stuffed animal companions and hamsters. This book was a wake-up call to me about makeup. I just started using makeup about a year ago, and for some reason it never occurred to me they'd test it on animals. I am giving up some favorite brands and using only cruelty free ones. This book is wonderful and thought provoking.\n",

Today, invasive research on great apes has mercifully ended (although such research on all other animals, including monkeys, continues), and We even have a quote from a National Institutes of Health spokesperson stating that chimps are “very social and sensitive animals” who deserve a peaceful retirement, conflicting mightily with the NIH’s successful battles against even the most conservative welfare improvements for apes in laboratories twenty and thirty years ago.\n",

Fouts was a dedicated teacher and friend to several chimps. His story is tender, insightful, and passionate. Both heartwarming and heartbreaking.

For ex., in early 1969, I had the thankless job of keeping her in the garage on laundry day while Susan Nichols used the washer in the Gardner's home to clean Washoe's clothes. Before, whenever Washoe had seen us gathering up her clothes, she'd know that the Gardner's backdoor would soon be open and she could sneak inside, where she would launch a chimp style raid: emptying the fridge, romping through the beds, and ransacking the closets. I always wound up frantically chasing her around the house. One time I turned on the vacuum cleaner to scare her out. This worked a little too well. in her panic to escape, she began defecating all across the Gardner's Persian rug.\n",
            "\n",
            "The new laundry day strategy had me luring Washoe away from the trailer by suggesting that we GO GARAGE PLAY before Susan gathered up the dirty clothes. Washoe was usually enthusiastic about this b/c we had fixed up th garage as a rainy day playroom. We painted jungle scenes on the walls and put in a mattress for Washoe to bounce on, a parachute to swing on, and rugs to roll in. It was big enough for her to ride her tricycle around or to have wagon rides in. Once we were inside I would surreptitiously paddock the door.\n",
            "\n",
            "This worked fine until Washoe looked out the window and saw Susan on her way to the Gardner's with the laundry. Then the garage became a prison and I was the big, bad brother. First she asked GO OUT. When I refused she signed, OPEN KEY, just in case I had forgotten how to get out. She even resorted to her most polite PLEASE OPEN. When I signed my refusal, she first began tickling me, then pinching and scratching, and finally tearing my shirt off. I was bigger than Washoe, but nowhere near as strong. I had to do something fast of these games would turn into major brother sister brawls.\n",

They would tell me that the \"bogeyman\" was in that room and he would \"get me if I went inside.\" There was no question that Washoe's bogeyman was big black dogs so I pointed to the locked garage door and signed BIG BLACK DOG OUT THERE. EAT LITTLE CHIMPANZEE. Right away Washoe's eyes got big and her hair stood on end. She stood up on two legs and began swaggering like one angry ape. She hammered on the wall with the back of her hand. Then, suddenly, she charged across the garage, leaping into the air at the last moment and slammed into the locked door with both feet. Then she came back over to me.\n",

            "\n",
            "These exchanges went considerably beyond the kind of non-verbal communication one can have with a chimpanzee using facial expression and body language, or with a dog through barks and single word commands. Washoe and I were communicating. Symbolically she gave me symbolic information - telling me to open the door and suggesting that I unlock it using the key. I responded with symbolic information, false though it way, about the big black dog. If I hadn't been able to conjure up a non-existent dog, and if Washoe hadn't been able to comprehend it, I might not have been able to defuse our conflict. My soon might have been acquiring English faster and more comprehensively than Washoe was acquiring American Sign Language, but they were both using language to communicate abstractly and effectively. For me, this was the most powerful evidence supporting Darwin's theory that human language emerged from our ape-like ancestor.\"\n",

This is a story of compassion, love, family, pain, suffering, torment, injustice, prejudice, science, psychology, sociology, evolutionary theory. It discusses the stiff moral boundaries that science has implemented/utilized to enslave emotional self aware beings and neglect our moral duties. Through his perspective we can change those views to cohabit the planet with those we have used as springboards for our gain only, leading to their suffering. Most importantly it's not told by a cold outsider unfamiliar with the realities of our kin. Roger Fouts shares true stories with a saintly unfiltered love that transcends his thesis from an argument to a beautiful tale/adventure that overrides bullshit and cuts straight to the capability of human love by sharing his insights that lead to a very clear understanding of the capacity of chimpanzees and just how alike we really are. This book is a 10/10 masterpiece. I cried, laughed, felt sorrow, peeked into beautiful windows, and felt so much for everyone involved in the tale that I felt that my own feelings were constantly on the line to be dismantled by the chaos of these poor (very adorable and loving)chimpanzees experiences.

That sounds terrible, but we lived on a farm and we were overrun with unwanted litters of kittens. But much worse is the situation in Fouts' book where hundreds, if not thousands, of chimpanzees were caged and subjected to all kinds of medical experiments, many of them cruel, literally a fate worse than death. Until relatively recently, chimpanzees were regarded as wild animals who had little in common with humans, and could be used for research, much as rats and mice are used. .\n",

            "What Fouts has done in this book is to demonstrate that chimpanzees are anything but animals Their dna is closer to humans than to any other animal. They're intelligent creatures who use language to communicate. And not just any mechanistic response to behaviorist rewards and punishment approach, but language as a broadly social activity. True, it's not a spoken language, but Fouts worked with chimpanzees and was able to teach them American sign language used by deaf people to go with their instinctive use of signs. It is as complex in its way as spoken language. They're sensitive, capable of humor found, for example, in jokes and teasing and lead lives of social interaction, just as humans do.\n",

            "The book is really made up of two parts, one describing his work with a number of chimpanzees, all named as they have distinct personalities, and the other describing his conflicts with researchers who refused to see them as any more than just dumb creatures to experiment on, usually tests for disease control. That meant being locked in small cages and dealt with by technicians. The rationale for this treatment was that if chimp research benefited even one human being then it was worthwhile. By those standards, Nazi scientists could justify laboratory research on feeble-minded individuals. People judged only by their utility to society means a lot of us, including the elderly, the infirm, and the mentally handicapped, would be lacking any worth and lost would be any intrinsic value we have as individuals and human beings.\n",

He is impressed with Jane Goodall and her work with chimpanzees in the African wilderness, but his primary concern is with the many chimpanzees who are already in this country, interacting with human beings in one form or another.\n",

It is, perhaps, our view of it as a separate world from our own that first gets us into trouble. The human being is an arrogant being. We like to think that we are the superior beast - the thinking, feeling, building, progressive being that rules the earth - but so often the human being is not so superior at all, but only... a beast. Fouts takes that arrogance down several notches. He reveals the remarkable intelligence of the chimpanzee mind. He reveals the astounding emotional depth of the chimpanzee heart. He unveils the tragic suffering of the chimpanzee life when we forget these emotional and intellectual capacities. In a time when scientific strides in all fields - space exploration, medical, or other - can easily be made without the torment of our animal brethren, this book bears witness to our human cruelty and argues effectively for an abandonment of such treatment forever. We are not, after all, a superior creature on this planet. We are only one among many, sharing a global environment to which all of our varied species have a right to live in, enjoying our freedom to live our lives without the threat of enslavement by others - human or animal.\n",

On multiple occasions, he references that once upon a time, people of color and women were not considered people, but that such views are now considered unthinkable--hence, he imagines a future where to relegate chimpanzees to the status of object and not subject would be considered similarly unthinkable. It is... an experience to read this part of the argument in 2014, when anti-Black racism is institutionalized to the point where legal institutions are causing more deaths in the African-American community than lynchings in the early 1900s and women who create public feminist work and research receive death threats for having done so. Fouts' ignorance of the fact that lots of people still aren't allowed to be people undermined the text to some degree.\n",

The more conventionally memoir sections were an absolute joy to read; I all but forced friends and family to listen to me retell stories of Lucy's and Washoe's personalities and lives on several occasions. The book is also in part a memoir of the conversion of an academic into an activist, the telling of which is done very frankly with regards to how that changes the meaning of a \"career.\" I recommend this book to anyone who has ever cared about the biosphere, the biomedical industry, or made a connection with a non-human animal.\n",

            "  Content: If you've ever stood by the chimpanzee pen at your favorite zoo trying to communicate with those on the other side of the glass, you'll love the tales by Roger Fouts of care-taking young chimp Washoe, teaching her American Sign Language, and drawing the linguistic, psychological, and ethical implications drawn from a lifetime of providing for her and the family of other chimps that came to surround her. There is lots of love and humor spread throughout the book watching the chimps and humans learn how to live together. Who can trick whom into doing what, in the interests of science, access to food, or just plain play? A quite different aspect of the tale emerges all too quickly - the reality of human treatment of chimpanzees in America while using them to explore space, study diseases, and test medicines. In contrast to the conditions in which Washoe spent most of her life, Fouts provides explicit descriptions of the all-too-cruel conditions under which hundreds of others spent theirs at the hands of American government, university, and business teams. Next of Kin builds a strong argument for examining and re-shaping the conditions within which we allow the kinds of uses of animals, in general, and chimpanzees, in particular, in our search to better our own lives.\n",

This book is a very rare combination of good science and excellent storytelling. It goes beyond informing its readers, which is what we usually expect from science non-fiction.

In this life-changing story about Roger, a compassionate primatologist trying to protect Washoe's family of chimpanzees who had acquired language, you will find yourself alternately laughing and heartbroken. Ultimately, it's a timeless lesson about the importance of love and compassion for all living things, an important message made even more relevant in our current political climate. It raises the question - if we readily objectify or demonize fellow humans who don't look or think like we do, how will we ever be able to extend our compassion to other species?

Although the book is not without examples of funny, charming or surprising chimpanzee behavior (such as one girl chimp's interest in Playboy magazine), the real heart of the story is about taking non-human animals seriously, commitment to your loved ones, and rethinking human treatment of non-human animals-- especially our treatment of them in the name of science.\n",

Still, it is a mostly well written book -- only occasionally tedious in its repetitiveness or indulgence of spending two pages making a point that was already conveyed in a sentence -- that gives a human and humane face to the cross species interactions that helped change the fundamental understanding of language development.

He also gives a impassioned plea for an end to animal research under conditions of fear, pain, and severe deprivation. Some of this was hard to read.

            "  Content: In the late 1960s and early 1970s, there were a series of experiments that were conducted on chimpanzees to determine if these animals were capable of understanding or producing human speech. At first, experiments involved the animals actually trying to make human sounds, but it was discovered that chimpanzees lack vocal cords, so they would be unable to make human voice sounds. For some reason, it was considered best that the subjects of these experiments were brought up as human children in human families and taught sign language. The sign language was not so strange, as chimpanzees in the wild do use gestures to communicate with each other. The chimpanzees began to use signs in a naturalistic way- up to about 360 varied signs, and one later was able to teach her child some signs. There was a controversy regarding this language research when one chimpanzee was studied and the methodology of the experiment was poor to be generous. Basically in this study the chimpanzee named Nim Chimpsky was rewarded for making signs. Which the other studies ruled out quite early because the point was not to create a reward-based system of communication but an actual system of communication. Because of this controversy, and also the fact that chimpanzee research was being directed towards finding cures for human diseases in the early 1980s, none of these experiments have been replicated. So we cannot conclusively say whether chimpanzees could theoretically communicate with human beings using sign language. Although, for me, it is incredibly obvious that they can seeing as they are our closest cousins and our ability to understand create and use language must have come from somewhere. So probably it came from the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees. There is an interesting sentence in the Wikipedia article about this topic. \" just because they can use the sign to communicate doesn't mean they know what the sign means say some deaf people.\" what a weirdly constructed sentence. I think if you know what the word water means, and you ask somebody water please or give me water or give me a glass of water you understand what it means. I think this attitude is just evidence that we do not as a species like to accept the fact that we are animals, much like chimpanzees but also like other animals as well. It also reminds me of watching parrots communicate. Parrots can understand some words, and they can use them to communicate with human beings, but parrots also just jabber away saying all kinds of meaningless things. And we can say well that's incoherent the parrots are just babbling - but isn't the majority of what we talk about also just babbling and only meaningful because we have attached some meaning to it? So maybe in the parrot mind there is some kind of meaning attached to the babbling, just like we attach some meaning to our babbling. But back to the book. The great part about this book is not what I just talked about, the great part about the book is the fact that it is a story of one man's understanding of the moral and ethical implications of testing basically people. I like the fact that he refers to his chimpanzee friends as friends and people with personalities and emotions, and that they are creatures that suffer. I have never heard any primatologist refer to the animals they study as people. We can assume that's because only humans are people, but why? Why couldn't a chimpanzee be a person. Especially if they share the same emotional life as us. So eventually the author becomes disillusioned with the whole idea of experimenting on chimpanzees, even though his results were mind-blowing. It's kind of like you treat someone as your friend or rather your relationship develops into one of friendship, but you started off doing really horrible experiments on them, and not only that, to do these experiments your friend's parents were murdered, and your friend was kidnapped and taken to another country and introduced into a culture that they can never fully fit into and because of their weird cultural upbringing they can never return to their home. There's a great moment when the chimpanzee subject of the experiment, Washoe, is first introduced to other chimpanzees, and she has this horrifying realization that she is also a chimpanzee and not a human being. I think if you are looking for more scientific explanation of animal intelligence, there are better books. For example, 'Are We Smart Enough to Know That Animals are Smart' is great for that. But this is a great book that explores not just animal cognition, but interspecies empathy.\n",

Yani bunlar diğer hayvanların refleksif ezberlemeleri değil, anlama ve bilişsel mantıklama sürecini de içeriyor. Örneğin MASA, ÇATAL ve ÜSTÜNDE kelimelerini bilen bir şempanze, “MASA ÜSTÜNDE ÇATAL” ile “ÇATAL ÜSTÜNDE MASA”yı ayırt edebiliyor. “SEN SARIL BANA” ve “BEN SARIL SANA” arasındaki farkı da biliyor ve kendileri ilk defa üretebiliyor.

Uygun olmayan vokal sistem kasları ve beyinde onu yönetecek nöral kontrolleri olmadığından, şempanzeler için işaret dili, sesli dile göre çok daha iyi bir alternatif. Zira bizim gibi konuşarak anlaşmak yerine (bizim evrimsel süreç içerisinde kaybettiğimiz) inanılmaz görsel hafızaları ve örüntü tanıma yetenekleri sayesinde hareketlerle iletişim sağlıyorlar.\n",

            "  Content: This is an excellent book about chimps communicating with American Sign Language. The author planned to be a child psychologist but an opportunity presented itself to work with Washoe the chimp on communication and they basically spent the next thirty years together. When I say the chimps communicate with ASL it's true. Back and forth with humans and chimp-to-chimp without human prompting with typical vocabularies of 150 to 200 words. He also spends a lot of time on how language is learned in humans and chimps which I expected to be dry but was not. He also spends time on the deplorable way these creatures are treated in biomedical experimentation. No need for specifics here but our closest living relative should be treated respectfully. There are many wonderful stories in this book. The chimps are very cool. A few of the descriptions of conditions in medical labs might be too much for some but books like these may cause improvements in care of these animals in testing environments. This is not a new book. Perhaps some changes have already been made. Highly recommended.\n",

            "  Content: This book took me a while to read. Not because it wasn't good, just due to the subject matter. It is fascinating, Informative, humbling and heartbreaking. I laughed, cried and wanted to talk about this book with someone else (one of those). It is the story of Roger Fouts a scientist who firstly worked with Washoe communicating using ASL (sign language). The detailed accounts of the conversations between humans and chimps is astonishing. Yet I read it with amazement and sadness (mainly that \"Intelligent\" accredited humans aware of this study continued to treat chimpanzees the way they did) Fouts manages to write with scientific knowledge explanations while battling his own scientist/human conscience. Through his work and with support from like minded animal charities, public awareness they were able to challenge and make changes to how animals in captivity ( and research labs) were/are treated. A must read for all humans!!\n",

However, the book had much more to do with Fouts' experiences with various chimps, but one in particular named Washoe. Fouts writes about his journey from meeting Washoe, to learning sign language, and finally all the way to trying to provide chimps all over the country with habitats to live out the rest of their days in.
